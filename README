What is simple-prof?
====================
simple-prof is for students learning to write performant C routines.  It makes
it simple to record the execution times of many trials of a routine and report
simple stats on those measurements (min, avg, stdev).


How do I use simple-prof?
=========================
Include simple-prof with `#include "simple_prof.h"`, compile with:
    gcc -lrt -lm simple_prof.c your-program.c

Typical usage:
  1. create a structure to store runs of timing data:

     p_data func_a_data = prof_init_data(NUM_TRIALS)

  2. for each trial, call the start and stop functions around your code-block:

     prof_start_trial(&fn_data);
     fn();
     prof_stop_trial(&fn_data);

  3. calculate some stats from the collected data:

     p_stats fn_stats = prof_get_stats(fn_data);

  4. optionally use this convenience function to print the stats:

     prof_print_stats(fn_stats);


Other Notes
===========
simple-prof uses a high resolution timer that should be unaffected by changes
to the system clock due to things like NTP jumps and skews.

simple-prof also provides functions to print the stats out in csv format.
